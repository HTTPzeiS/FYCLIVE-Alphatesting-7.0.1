    <center><h1>how does this steal? well, it's simple. Step 1. It will take a while but press run and scroll down then rinse and repeat. Step 2. Let it run overnight you may not get a single one but if you did get one good for you. Step 3. To know you got one check the 'addresses with balance' window each. Last but not least Step 4. STEAL EVERYTHING AND DON'T GET CAUGHT DOING IT EITHER. NOTE: be careful about what private key you stealing from because you could be in the window copy the address and find yourself stealing from a government address. Ok back to Step 4. in the window copy the private keys you have been patiently waiting for and find a wallet you could import them to Ethereum wallets and bitcoin wallets aren't the same I would recommend importing them to a multi-coin wallet of any kind CONGRATS YOU ARE A OFFICIAL ETHEREUM STEALING PRO. </h1></center>        <center><h1>Happy stealing :)</h1></center>
