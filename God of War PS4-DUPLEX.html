    Release Info:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    From Santa Monica Studio and creative director Cory Barlog comes a new
    beginning for one of gaming's most recognizable icons. Living as a man
    outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands,
    unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his
    son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to
    fulfill a deeply personal quest.
    
     Bold New Beginning - His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years
    behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and
    monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to
    survive.And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God
    of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series-satisfying
    combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative-and fuses them anew.
    
     A Second Chance - Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to
    Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and
    control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous
    world with his son.
    
     A Darker, More Elemental World - From the marble and columns of ornate
    Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore,
    this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters,
    and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will
    draw players in to explore God of War's breathtakingly threatening
    landscape-by far the largest in the franchise.
    
     Vicious, Physical Combat - With an over the shoulder free camera that
    brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War
    mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and
    grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of
    God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new
    ground in the genre.
